# Exercises with pandas

1. Read "planets.csv" using pandas to create DataFrame/Table with the exoplanet
data.
    a) Find out various methods used to detect exoplanets. So the dataframe
    based on detection method and masses of the exoplanets, Also then split the
    the dataframe into many, one for each detection method.

    b) For each of the dataframe corresponding to different detection methods,
    arrange exoplanets in ascending order of there masses.
    Combine these multiple dataframes into one preserving the order. Compare
    both the sorted dataframes.

    c) Find out all the parent stars having exoplanet with mass larger than 1
    jupiter mass, radius larger than jupiter radius. Plot the mass-radius plot
    for these particular parent stars with error bars

    (To understand splitting, indexing, hierarchical indexing, groupby, pivot_tables etc)

2. Write a function to calculate cubic polynomial over some range of the independent
variable.
    a) The the data and recover(fit) the coefficients.

    b) Now add standard gaussian noise. Again fit the coefficients.

    c) Change the amplitude of the noise to add to the data and plot how it

    affects the recovery of the coefficients.
    d) Now try to fit the cubic polynimial data with quadratic polynomial.

    Find out the distance between the fit and actual data.
    (Hint: polyfit)


3. Read the time series data given the data file. For each time t, the time series
follows the random distribution which is the sum of the two Gaussins.
    a) Using the data, find out the parameters of both Gaussians.

    b) Create a similar data using fitted parameters and compare them using histograms.
    (Hint: curve fit from scipy optimize)

    c) Also calculate   power spectral density (PSD) of the given time series data.
